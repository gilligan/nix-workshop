# Nix: The Big Picture

### So what is Nix?

- A _package manager_
- A _purely functional programming language_
- A _build tool_

# Nix: The Big Picture

### So someone wrote another package manager ...

---

# Nix: The Big Picture

### Nix has some nice qualities

- deterministic & reproducible
- stateless & declarative
- actually hard to really screw things up

---
# Nix: The Big Picture

### Nix has some NOT SO nice qualities

- steep learning curve
- lack of documentation
- cli tools UX needs work
- sometimes collides with the "impure" rest of the world

---
# Nix: The Big Picture

### The nix package manager

- We can (un-)install software (_obviously_..)
- Software can be installed per user (_user profile_)
- nixpkgs is the official collection of nix packages

---

# Nix: The Big Picture

### Do you have Nix installed ?

```shell
$ nix-env --version
nix-env (Nix) 2.2.2
```

### Not installed?

```shell
$ curl https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh
$ source ~/.nix-profile/etc/profile.d/nix.sh
$ nix-env --version
```

---

# Nix: The Big Picture

### Intermission: Nix versions

- **0.x**: `nix-env`, `nix-instantiate`, `nix-shell`, ...
- **2.x**: `nix <cmd>`

Nix 2.x introduced a revamp of the nix cli tools. Tools from both versions
are still being used. This is a bit messy :(

---

# Nix: The Big Picture

### Using `nix-env`

- most frequently used tool
- badly named
- use it to query, install, uninstall packages

ðŸ’¥ **Hands-On**
```
$ nix-env -q                     # what does this show?
$ nix-env -qa                    # what about this command?
$ nix-env -i hello && nix-env -q # makes sense?
$ which hello                    # where is hello (hint: symlinks!)
$ nix-env -e hello               # goodbye hello
```

---

# Nix: The Big Picture

### The Nix Store

```shell
$ which hello
/home/gilligan/.nix-profile/bin/hello

$ readlink -f $(which hello)
/nix/store/83vqfmpq19g0rkgjf0sa319x919p0vvg-hello-2.10/bin/hello
```

- **Everything** always ends up in the Nix store
- This conflicts with FHS
- This brings plenty of benefits

ðŸ’¥ **Hands-On**
- Benefits? Why is having everything in /nix/store any good?
- Remove `hello` and then check if path is gone from the store

---

# Nix: The Big Picture

### Where Things Actually Go

```shell
$ which hello
~/.nix-profile/bin/hello

$ ls -l ~/.nix-profile
~/.nix-profile -> /nix/var/nix/profiles/per-user/gilligan/profile

$ ls -l /nix/var/nix/profiles/per-user/gilligan/profile
/nix/var/nix/profiles/per-user/gilligan/profile-119-link
```

ðŸ’¥ **Hands-On**
- (Un-)Installing software is just symlinking. How so?
- How to *really* remove software? How to really delete the files?
- Try `nix-env --list-generation` and `nix-env --switch-generation`

---
# Nix: The Big Picture

### Where Things Are Coming From

```shell
$ nix-channel --list
nixpkgs https://nixos.org/channels/nixpkgs-unstable

$ nix-channel --update
unpacking channels...
created 2 symlinks in your user environment
```
**The nix channels**
* You can subscribe to different **channels**
* `nixpkgs-unstable`, `nixos-19.03`, `nixos-18.09`, ...
* They provide _metadata_ on all available packages
* The channels do _not_ contain actual binaries
---
# Nix: The Big Picture

### Where Things Are Coming From (2)

**Q: So where does all that package "metadata" in the channels come from?**

**A: From https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs**

All channels are just different commits on different branches of this repository. We will look at this repository more closely later on.

# Nix: The Big Picture

### And now ...

---
# Nix: The Big Picture

### nix-shell

* May not seem like much but nix-shell is a powerful tool
* You can use it to create project specific environments
* You can also use it to just quickly test something without installing it


ðŸ’¥ **Hands-On**
* `nix-shell -p cowsay`
* `nix-shell --pure -p cowsay` -- **what is different?**
* What could a **pure** shell be good for?
---

# Nix: The Big Picture

### nix-shell: can we make it declarative?

Ad-hoc use of `nix-shell` is nice but we also want to be able to make it
reproducible:

```Nix
{ pkgs ? import <nixpkgs> {} }:

pkgs.mkShell {

  buildInputs = [ pkgs.cowsay ];

  shellHook = ''
    echo "Welcome in the cowsay shell"
  '';
}
```

ðŸ’¥ **Hands-On**
* Add the above to a file called `shell.nix`
* Run `nix-shell`
---

# Nix: The Big Picture
### We have written and used our first Nix expression

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/1PMVNNKVIL8Ig/giphy.gif)

_(now we just need to figure out what all of it means..)_
---
# Nix: The Big Picture

### Decomposing the file line by line

```Nix
{ pkgs ? import <nixpkgs> {} }:
```
* We are looking at the head of a function declaration
* The function takes 1 argument, an _attribute set_
* The attribute key has 1 _key_: `pkgs`
* The key `pkgs` has a _default value_
---
# Nix: The Big Picture

### Decomposing the file line by line

```Nix
{ pkgs ? import <nixpkgs> {} }:
```
```Nix
import <nixpkgs> {}
```
```Nix
<nixpkgs>
```

* `nixpkgs` is just a (global) variable
* Look at the output `echo $NIX_PATH`
---
# Nix: The Big Picture

### Decomposing the file line by line

```Nix
{ pkgs ? import <nixpkgs> {} }:
```
```Nix
import <nixpkgs> {}
```

* `import` allows us to import other nix files
* The **nixpkgs** variable points to a path which we are importing
* The extra `{}` are there because we are importing a function
* The function is executed and we get back a set
* If you look at the **nixpkgs** path it is a checkout of `NixOS/nixpkgs`!
---
### Decomposing the file line by line

#### Putting it together again ...

```Nix
{ pkgs ? import <nixpkgs> {} }:
```

* Function with one argument `pkgs`
* If `pkgs` is not given we import **nixpkgs**
* **nixpkgs** is the version of nixpkgs on your system

ðŸ’¥ **Hands-On**
* Can you spot any problems or downside with this approach?
---
# Nix: The Big Picture

### Decomposing the file line by line
```Nix
pkgs.mkShell { ... }
```
* `pkgs` is bound to the result of importing `nixpkgs`
* `pkgs` is itself a set with attributes and functions
* `mkShell` is a function that we can call
---
# Nix: The Big Picture

### Decomposing the file line by line
```Nix
{
  buildInputs = [ pkgs.hello ];
  ...
}
```
* We are creating an attribute set
* `buildInputs` is a key
* `[ pkgs.hello ]` is a value (a single element list)
---
# Nix: The Big Picture

### Decomposing the file line by line

```Nix
shellHook = ''
  echo "Welcome!"
'';
```

* `shellHook` is another attribute in our attribute set
* Nix lets us use `''` to create multi-line strings

---
# Nix: The Big Picture

### Decomposing the file line by line

#### Putting it all back together again

```Nix
{ pkgs ? import <nixpkgs> {} }:

pkgs.mkShell {

  buildInputs = [ pkgs.cowsay ];

  shellHook = ''
    echo "Welcome in the cowsay shell"
  '';
}
```
This is a very simple example of how we can declaratively define an environment that we can enter with `nix-shell`

---
# by now we learned ...

- (un-)installing software with `nix-env`
- about `/nix/store`
- about **channels** and **nixpkgs**
- about `nix-shell`
- creating a declarative shell environment

# we still need look at ...

- the nix language
- using `nix-build`
- building our own app with nix
- adding a tool to nixpkgs

# Nix: Digging Deeper
### The Nix Language: Strings

```Nix
"I am a String"
```
```Nix
''Me
"as well"
''
```

```Nix
"foo" + "bar" # => "foobar"
```

```Nix
foo = "hello world"
"${foo} !" # => "hello world !"
```
---

# Nix: Digging Deeper
### The Nix Language: Numbers

```Nix
2 + 2 # => 4
```

```Nix
2/2 # => !!! /home/foo/2/2 !!!
```

```Nix
2 / 2 # => 1
```

---

# Nix: Digging Deeper
### The Nix Language: Booleans

```Nix
1 < 2
true
```

```Nix
1 > 2
false
```

```Nix
true || false # => true
true && false # => false
```

---

# Nix: Digging Deeper
### The Nix Language: Lists

```Nix
[1 "foo" false]
```

```Nix
builtins.head [1 "foo" false] # => 1
```

```Nix
builtins.elemAt [1 "foo" false] 0 # => 1
```
---

# Nix: Digging Deeper
### The Nix Language: Sets

```Nix
{ a = 0; b = 1; c = "2" }
```

```Nix
{ a = 0; b = 1; c = "2" }.a # => 0
```

```Nix
rec { a = 0; b = 1; c = ''this is "${a}"''}.c # => "this is 0"
```

* self-reference requires **recursive sets** -> `rec`

---

# Nix: Digging Deeper
### The Nix Language: Functions

```Nix
id = x: x
id 3 # => 3
```

```Nix
add = x: y: x + y
add 1 3 # => 4
```

```Nix
hello = { prefix, name }: "Hello ${prefix} ${name} !"
hello {prefix = "Mr"; name = "Bond"; } # => "Hello Mr Bond"
```
---
# Nix: Digging Deeper
### The Nix Language: Rest Arguments

```Nix
f = args@{a, ...}: a + args.b
f {a=1; b=2;} # => 3
```

If you don't want to depend on a set of arguments but only expect
some single args to be there this is a good fit

---
# Nix: Digging Deeper
### The Nix Language: Let Bindings

```Nix
let
  person = { name = "john"; age = 42; };
  showPerson = x: "called ${x.person} aged ${x.age}";
in
  showPerson person # => "called john aged 42"
```

Let make a set of bindings (here `person` and `showPerson`) available in the context
that follows `in`

---
# Nix: Digging Deeper
### The Nix Language: With Keyword

```Nix
buildInputs = with pkgs; [ nano emacs vim ];
```
```Nix
with {a=1; b=2;}; {foo=a;}
```
**with** allows you to extract variables from a set and include them into the scope of the with-body.

**NOTE**: This can be very useful but also confusing: It can lead to situation where it is not obvious where some value actually comes from -- **with** is not very explicit.

---
# Nix: Digging Deeper
### The Nix Language: Imports

```Nix
# foo.nix

{
    hello = x: "hello ${x}"
}
```
```Nix
# main.nix

hello = (import ./foo.nix).hello
hello "batman" # => "hello batman"
```

---
# Nix: Digging Deeper
### The Nix Language: Conditionals

```Nix
silly = x: if x > 42 then "yay" else "silly number"

silly 1  # => "silly number"
silly 43 # => "yay"
```

Nix has **if/then/else** clauses like most other languages.

### Extending Our Shell Environment (Hands-On!)

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/26u4lOMA8JKSnL9Uk/giphy.gif)
---

# Nix: Digging Deeper
### Extending Our Shell Environment: Passing Arguments

You can pass arguments to `nix-shell`: 

```shell
$ nix-shell --arg foo 42        # => passes arg `foo` with value 42

$ nix-shell --argstr name sally # => passes arg `name` with value "sally"
```

You basically just tell `nix-shell` which additional function arguments you would like
to supply.

---
# Nix: Digging Deeper
### Extending Our Shell Environment: Testing Your Code

```shell
$ nix-instantiate --eval shell.nix
<LAMBDA>
```

```shell
$ nix-instantiate --eval --expr '"foobar"'
"foobar"
```

```shell
$ nix repl
nix-repl> x = 42
nix-repl> x
42
nix-repl>
```

Use any combination of the above to test/verify Nix code. For `shell.nix` you can of course also just run `nix-shell` and see what happens ;)

---
# Nix: Digging Deeper
### Extending Our Shell Environment

```Nix
{ pkgs ? import <nixpkgs> {} }:
pkgs.mkShell {
  buildInputs = [ pkgs.cowsay ];
  shellHook = ''echo "Welcome in the cowsay shell"'';
}
```

ðŸ’¥ **Hands-On**
- Adjust `shell.nix` to use **either** `cowsay` **or** `hello` to print a welcome message
- Adjust `shell.nix` to take a `production` argument. In production mode it should print a warning message

# Nix: Digging Deeper
### Building Our First Package

- We are going to write our first **derivation**
- **Actually** we've been doing that before but nobody noticed..

---
# Nix: Digging Deeper
### Building Our First Package: "Derivation"

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/glmRyiSI3v5E4/giphy.gif)
---
# Nix: Digging Deeper
### Building Our First Package: What Is A Derivation?

**A derivation from the language perspective:**

```Nix
{ name, system, builder }
```

A set that needs 3 specific attributes. This is:

1. correct
2. not very useful right now

---
# Nix: Digging Deeper
### Building Our First Package: What Is A Derivation?

**What is a derivation conceptually?:**

- A **derivation** contains information on how to build a package 
- Nix can **consume** a derivation to create an output
- Nix first creates `.drv` files and from that the actual output

---
# Nix: Digging Deeper
### Building Our First Package: What Is A Derivation?

**A useful analogy:**

- `*.nix` == `*.c`
- `*.drv` == `*.o`
- output store path == actual package

---
# Nix: Digging Deeper
### Building Our First Package: What Is A Derivation?

1. **Evaluation** Phase: `.nix` -> `.drv`
2. **Build** Phase: `.drv` -> `outPath`

---
# Nix: Digging Deeper
### Building Our First Package: What Is A Derivation?

**Confusing? The Good News Is:**

- We do not really have to care about all those details that much.
- There are enough useful abstractions that help us
---

# Nix: Digging Deeper
### Building Our First Package: Packaging a silly script

```shell
#!/usr/bin/env bash

echo "hello workshop"
cowsay "howdy"
```

**Our task is to turn this silly script into a Nix package**

---
# Nix: Digging Deeper
### Building Our First Package: Packaging a silly script

```Nix
# default.nix

{ pkgs ? import <nixpkgs> {} }:

with pkgs;

stdenv.mkDerivation {
  name = "silly-hello";
  version = "1.0";
  src = ./.;

  buildInputs = [ bash makeWrapper cowsay gnugrep ];

  buildPhase = "";

  installPhase = ''
    mkdir -p $out/bin
    cp ./hello $out/bin/silly-hello
    chmod +x $out/bin/silly-hello
    wrapProgram $out/bin/silly-hello\
        --prefix PATH : ${lib.makeBinPath [ cowsay ]}
  '';
}
```

# We actually got here? I am surprised
